    <p>I started diving when I was just 12 Years old. By the time I was 13 I had completed my open water certification
    and a month later I was living with complete stragers on a boat in the caribbean through a teen summer camo program called
    <a href="https://www.gobroadreach.com/students/high-school-summer-adventures/">Broadreach.</a>
    I spent 3 weeks on that boat and came back a rescue diver. I complted 21 dives in 21 days and I was now determined to get
    in 50 dives so I could go from a beginner to an expert in under a year.
    I got my <a href="https://www.micds.org/news/article/student-standouts-for-april-29-2022/">Master Scuba Certification</a>
    11 months after I was initially certified. Today I have 83 dives and plan to go into the feild professionaly.</p>.</td>
